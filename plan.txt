1. Chart out processes, sketch pages needed
2. Rough flask outline
3. Rough html pages
4. Implement sqlalchemy ORM
5. Get it up and running - ugly working first draft
6. Note any deficiencies that need to be fixed or implemented now
- Remove url from database
- Add url generation to server
- Add cart links -everywhere-
- Add checkout link to cart
7. Quickly review stripe(?) process and dependencies to confirm validity of next steps
8. Implement sessions for shopping cart
- This is deceptively complex, since the session dictionary-like object converts variables into json data.
    I think I'm over thinking my changes, though.
    -Got it!
9. Implement placeholder checkout process - maximize compatibility with stripe for easy integration
- understand stripe price ids
- Looks like generating and storing product data in stripe might be the easiest approach to implement and understand.
- Not sure whether I ought to duplicate this data elsewhere in my app.
- actually, redesigning for stripe looks unnecessary.
- Currently using placeholders, may create a carmen sandiego inspired monument black market.
10. Test shopping cart behavior
11. Add styling?
12. Implement stripe(?)


I could add:
* Login to view purchased items
* Admin login to add items for sale, update stock available

* Consider including web store. This would require:
    * Finish web store functionality - happy path
    * Upload or create a dataset
        - I could create a few datasets and styles
        and allow the user to tab between them
    * Add simple styling
    * Do a little testing
    * Finish the assignment by adding users
